		<p>Welcome to NLB</p>
		<h2>Routes</h2>
		<p>In NLB, routes are used to create a mapping between a particular path and a controller that should handle that path. Access
		restrictions can also be added to a route preventing certain users from accessing certain areas of your application. NLB has a list
		of it's own routes in the config/nlb_routes.inc.php file. To define your own routes you must use the config/routes.inc.php file.
		Below is a simple routes.inc.php file defining some routes that would be used for a simple blog:</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
&lt;?php
$routes = array(
	'blog' => array(
		'handler' => 'custom/blog.php?action=list',
		'access' => array('anonymous user'),
	),
	'blog/%post_id' => array(
		'handler' => 'custom/blog.php?action=viewpost&amp;id=%post_id',
		'access' => array('anonymous user'),
	),
);
			</code>
		</pre>
	</body>
